## Introduction

Earthquake Data Analysis is a Python project aimed at exploring and visualizing earthquake data sourced from CSV files. The project utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

The main objectives of this project are:
- Clean and preprocess earthquake data to prepare it for analysis.
- Explore patterns and trends in earthquake occurrences, magnitudes, and depths.
- Visualize data using various types of plots such as scatter plots, histograms, and time series plots.
- Provide insights into earthquake occurrences based on geographic location and magnitude.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format data for consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Calculate descriptive statistics, visualize distributions, and explore correlations.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots including scatter plots for magnitude vs. depth, histograms for magnitude distributions, and time series plots for earthquake frequency over time.
- **Resampling and Aggregation**: Analyze earthquake data over different time intervals (e.g., monthly averages).
- **Date Manipulation**: Convert date strings to datetime objects, extract year, month, and day information for analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dmiqava/Quiz3-4
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data:**
   - Ensure your earthquake data is in CSV format and contains columns such as Date, Time, Latitude, Longitude, Magnitude, Depth, etc.

2. **Run the analysis script:**
   - Execute the script to perform data cleaning, EDA, and visualization tasks.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Explore the generated plots:**
   - After running the script, explore the generated plots in the `output/` directory.
   - Use these visualizations to gain insights into earthquake patterns and characteristics.
